\subsection{\ctr{1\protect\minor} opening}
\label{subsec:1min-op}

Opening in a minor suit promises \hcp{11}{} with \suit{5+}{\minor} or \hcp{12}{} with \bal\/ shape. The upper limit
is defined by \hyperref[subsec:2c-op]{\ctr{2\c} opening}, so it varies depending on the hand's shape. \suit{5+}{\major}
is not possible. \ctr{1\d} promisses at last \suit{4+}{\d} in any case, while \ctr{1\c} promisses only \suit{2+}{\c}
and clubs \emph{should} be longer than diamonds.

When hand is \bal, (no more than \suit{5+}{cards} in any suit), strength intervals \hcp{15}{17} and \hcp{20}{22} are
excluded into \ctr{1\nt} and \ctr{2\nt} openings respectively.

\sequence{1\minor\ --- ?}
\begin{itemize}
  \newcommand{\nomajor}[1]{\no\ \suit{#1+}{\major}}

  \item \ctr{1\d} -- \hcp{4}{} \suit{4+}{\d}, diamonds longer than any major suit
  \item \ctr{1\major} -- \hcp{4}{} \suit{4+}{\major}, spades no longer than hearts
  \item \ctr{1\nt} -- \nat, \hcp{6}{12}, \suit{4+}{\c} (or \suit{4}{\d} in \bal\/ shape)
  \item \ctr{2\minor} (\opn's suit) -- \semi\nat, \inv+ \suit{4+}{\minor}, \nomajor{4}
  \item \ctr{2\minor} (other minor) -- \nat\ \gf, \suit{5+}{\minor}, \nomajor{5}
  \item \ctr{2\major} -- \nat\ \gf\/ very solid \suit{6+}{\major} (slam aspirations)
  \item \ctr{2\nt} -- \nat\ \inv \bal\/ hand
  \item \ctr{3\minor} (\opn's suit)-- \nat\ \preempt\ \hcp{4}{7} (following \emph{the law of total tricks})
  \item \ctr{3 other suit} -- \nat\ \inv\ \suit{6+}{} with 2 honours at least.
  \item \ctr{3\nt} -- \so
\end{itemize}
