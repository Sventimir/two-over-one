\subsection{\ctr{2\protect\d} opening (\conv{Multi})}
\label{subsec:2d-op}

\ctr{2\d} opening, known as \conv{Multi} promises a hand beneath an opening limit with \suit{6+}{\major}.
Occaasionally a solid 5-card suit might also suffice. \vspace{1em}

\sequence{\ctr{2\d} --- ?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \ctr{2\h} -- \neg, basically this response does not promise anything
  \item \ctr{2\s} -- \h\ preference; this response expreses willingness to play \ctr{3\h}, but not \ctr{3\s}
  \item \ctr{2\nt} -- \gf, \ask{further hand description}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \ctr{3\c} -- \pos\/ hand (at least 2 major trump honours)\footnote{
      \emph{Responder} now asks \ctr{3\d} and \opn\/ bids the major suit he \textbf{does not} have.
    }
    \item \ctr{3\d} -- \neg\/ hand with \h\ suit
    \item \ctr{3\h} -- \neg\/ hand with \s\ suit
    \item \ctr{3\s} -- exactly AKQ(J)xxx in \h, nothing more
    \item \ctr{3\nt} -- exactly AKQ(J)xx in \s, nothing more
  \end{itemize}
  \item \ctr{3\c} -- \gf\/ with own solid $6+$ suit
  \item \ctr{3\d} -- \inv\/ to game \ws{} in both majors
  \item \ctr{3\h} -- \preempt\/ \ws{} in both majors
  \item \ctr{4\c} -- requests that partner bid transfer to his suit
  \item \ctr{4\d} -- requests that partner bid game in his suit directly
\end{itemize}
