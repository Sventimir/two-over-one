\subsection{\ctr{2\protect\c} opening}
\label{subsec:2c-op}

\ctr{2\c} opening is ``\emph{almost}\gf''. It promises a strong hand with $8.5$ tricks, usually on a single long suit,
or \hcp{23}{} in \bal\/ shape. \vspace{1em}

\sequence{\ctr{2\c} --- ?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \ctr{2\d} -- \art\ \gf, ensures enough strength to play a game
  \item \ctr{2\h} -- \neg, warns the \opn\/ that \resp\/ intends to pass any non-jumping rebid
  \item \ctr{2\s} -- \suit{5+}{\s}
  \item \ctr{2\nt} -- \suit{5+}{\h}
  \item \ctr{3\minor} -- \suit{5+}{\minor}
  \item \ctr{3\major} -- very solid major suit (can be played against \opn's singleton)
  \item \ctr{4\minor} -- very solid minor suit (can be played against \opn's singleton)
\end{itemize}
