\subsection{\ctr{2\protect\major} openings}
\label{subsec:2maj-op}

These openings both describe a hand beneath opening limit, containing at least 5 cards in the bid suit and another
5-card suit (with both majors open \ctr{2\h}). \vspace{1em}

There are few options of further bidding. \ctr{2\nt} reponse is \gf\ \ask{the other suit}. The \opn shows second
suit natrually, then return to the opening suit by responder settles a game in that suit, \ask{a cue-bid}, while direct
cue-bid on 4th level settles a game in the other suit. \textsc{Attention}: if \opn\/ opened \ctr{2\h} with both majors,
he reponds to \ctr{2\nt} with \ctr{3\h}, not \ctr{3\s}! \vspace{1em}

Response on 3rd level just below the opening suit (i.e. \sequence{\ctr{2\h} -- \ctr{3\d}} and \sequence{\ctr{2\s} --
\ctr{3\h}}) is \inv\ \ws{} in the opening suit. \vspace{1em}

Other responses are weak, \nat\/ showing support in the bid suit and all suits above. The \opn is to correct to his
other suit if the \resp didn't bid it. \vspace{1em}

A \dbl\/ in response to these openings shows support in at least one unbid suit and demands the \opn\/ to \pass\/ if he
has 5 cards in the opponent's suit or bid his lowest possible suit otherwise.
